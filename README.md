## Development

### Setup the project

Install [`composer`](https://getcomposer.org/) as a PATH in your computer,
this will help you get the Laravel installer in your computer:

```bash
$ composer global require "laravel/installer"
```

You also need MySQL installed in your computer.

After installing please you can follow this simple steps:

1. Clone this repository into your local machine

```bash
https://github.com/ProyectoIntegrador2018/prepanet.git
```

2. Create an .env file inside the main folder of the project and fill it up with your credentials.

3. Fire up a terminal and run:

```bash
$ composer update
```

4. Run the migration and the seeding of the database.

```bash
$ php artisan migrate -seed
```

### Running the stack for Development

1. Fire up a terminal and run: 

```
php artisan serve
```

If you have PHP installed locally and you would like to use PHP's built-in development server to serve your application, you may use the serve Artisan command. This command will start a development server at http://localhost:8000:

### Stop the project

In order to stop crowdfront as a whole you can run:

```
% php artisan down
```

### Restoring the database

You probably won't be working with a blank database, so once you are able to run crowdfront you can restore the database, to do it, first stop all services:

```
% php artisan down
```

Then just lift up the `db` service:

```
% php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```
